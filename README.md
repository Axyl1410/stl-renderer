# Viewing STL files on GitHub

Did you know you can [view 3D files with `.stl` extensions on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/working-with-non-code-files#3d-file-viewer)? Try viewing [`chrisreddington-19-24-github-skyline.stl`](chrisreddington-19-24-github-skyline.stl).

> [!WARNING]  
> Do not confuse GitHub's [STL rendering](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/working-with-non-code-files#3d-file-viewer) with its [SEAL rendering](https://github.com/leereilly/SEAL-renderer/blob/master/seal.gif).
